Problem Statement: SYSTEM TO DETECT HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE WHILE DRIVING 
SOLUTION : Smartphone-based Blood pressure measurement using Transdermal Optical Imaging Technology while driving

HOW IT WORKS

Video Capture : TOI starts by capturing images of the subject using any conventional video camera ( smart phone )

Face Detection and Tracking : TOI automatically detects and tracks your face identifying key regions of interest 

Blood Flow Data Extraction : Human skin is translucent. Light and its respective wavelengths are reflected at different layers below the skin and can be used to reveal blood flow information in the human face. This information is captured by and contained in conventional video images.

Signal Processing and Deep Learning: Advanced signal processing and deep learning models are used to predict the blood pressure of the driver.
